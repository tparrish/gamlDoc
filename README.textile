h1. GamlDoc

GAMLDoc is a tool to generate HTML documentation from GAML binding files

h2. Usage

To generate documentation all you need to do is invoke the default ant task. like so:

<pre>
ant
</pre>

This will look for the bindings file in the root of the project in a file called bindings.xml. If you want to generate documentation for a file elsewhere on your computer pass in an additional argument called <code>bindings.input.file</code>:

<pre>
ant -Dbindings.input.file=/home/cnorris/dubitPlatform/conf/bindings.xml
</pre>

HTML documentation will be spat out into the dist/ directory in both cases, and from there you're entry point is index.html

h2. Compiling the ant tasks

If you want to make alterations to the ant tasks you need to call the following:

<pre>
ant compile-tasks
</pre>

This will compile all the code in the src/ directory and bundle it up into a jar which will replace the one in the root. If you want to define more tasks there's a target in the build file called define-ant-tasks, add your new definitions in there.

Dependency management is taken care of through Apache Ivy so please put any dependencies you have in that rather than in the repository.
